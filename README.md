# ClibSync App
### Copy once, paste everywhere with ease!

 The purpose of this project is to develop a clipboard sync application that allows users to copy and paste text or files across multiple devices seamlessly. The application will provide a centralized location for storing and accessing copied data from any device, making it easy to transfer information between different platforms and devices. You donâ€™t have to copy texts into your messenger to access them on your computer.
